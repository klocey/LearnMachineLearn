**healthcareai**:
The healthcare.ai software is designed to streamline healthcare machine learning. They do this by including functionality specific to healthcare, as well as simplifying the workflow of creating and deploying models.  
See: https://healthcare.ai/

Includes both python and R distributions.

* R:```https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/healthcareai/index.html```
* Python:```https://healthcareai-py.readthedocs.io/en/master/getting_started/```

The python distribution is less supported and is noted to have some bugs. The R version is better supported and installable via CRAN and RStudio.
